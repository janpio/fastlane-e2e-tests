# fastlane-manual-integration-tests

This project contains mobile app projects configured with [fastlane](https://fastlane.tools) integration that can be used to manually test all fastlane functionality. Its goal is to complement fastlane's automated test suite that is run on each commit - as some of the more interactive or connected steps just aren't and can't effectively be tested there.

The steps necessary to executes these manual tests are documented in the projects.
