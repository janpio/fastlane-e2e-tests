# fastlane-manual-integration-tests

This repository contains multiple mobile app projects configured with [_fastlane_](https://fastlane.tools) integration. They can be used to manually test a good part of all fastlane functionality.

Its goal is to complement fastlane's automated test suite that is run on each commit, merge and release - as some of the more interactive or connected steps just can't and this aren't effectively tested by automated tests.
